    content: "We got picked up just around 4, gear loaded in the back and a few cold beers in hand. Timmo driving talking about the Arsenal as soon as. On the drive over, we had Thin Lizzy and The Clash running through the speakers. Bit of a mix, but it suited the mood.\nAt some point, someone mentioned Marc Bolan, and that kicked off a whole chat about rock legends who checked out too young. We got into the whole '27 Club' thing, then it turned into a proper conversation about drummers—specifically Bonham and Keith Moon. Both absolute monsters behind the kit. Both dead at 32. Both gone in September. That hit a bit harder than expected. Other than that, chat really was all football. Toon's top 5 chances and Leeds successes.\n We rolled into Sheffield around 6. Sidney and Malilda is somwehere we've played before. It's a great little venue! Aziz Ibrahim played on the other stage (of Stone Roses fame) to mark our dining with the finest. Before load-in, the lads hit a little burrito place a street over. No idea what it was called, but it saved the day because of the general hanger that is associated with certain memebers. We got to catch up with James, the drummer from Mint, who was roadie-ing for us. It was good to hear what Mint were up to. It's been a while since we've seen them.\nWe had a solid chat with a fan about the setlists, how the new stuff's sounding live, and a bit about the Sheffield scene. Always surreal when someone is that invested.\nThe gig itself was great on a wooden riser stage. There wasn't much movement but you could feel the buzz bouncing back off the walls. We did our best, as always, and walked off with an awkward hug from a chap in the middle of the floor.\nOn the way back, we picked the '27 Club' thread back up. It really is mad that Sid Vicious died at 21. The epitome of punk dying in a punkish way.",

      "This one was a belter. Tiredness was the first thought as we got in the van. That soon dissipated as Wilfy, our resident brewer, handed over a cold one. The Met Lounge is always one to look forward to. We always get people through the door.\nWe got picked uo at the usual 4ish time. We decided on the drive down to change the setlist up to accommodate for some new tunes- Life In The Fast Brain as an opener. More chat about football as always and a good debate about the place to eat. Wethers was decided pretty quickly.\nArrived and gave Steve, the owner, some banter about looking like Ki-Adi-Mundi and wearing his staple AC Milan shorts. It's probably the worst load-in with the steepest steps up to the venue. The other bands started arriving soon after and we had a small conversation with them.\nPeterborough was feeling the effects of a day in the sun and the walk to Wethers after soundcheck was pleasant. The food was decent and we had a few more bevvies.\nWe arrived back at the venue as the first band started. Both the support bands were very good. I can't remember being able to play like at the age of 18. Blows your mind! Met a man in the bog who said he was 'absolutely buzzing for this'\nThe energy on stage was electric. We had a real vibe going. A fan to the right was absolutely loving it! A lovely chap who ended up spending far more than we expected as well as giving us some encouraging words.\nAfterwards we had a chat with the second support band and discussed their upcoming A levels. Turns out their teacher was a friend of ours back in our own school days. It is a small world. Some fans also told us to play in Lincoln as they had come from that way to see us. The best thing about being in a band is chatting to people who care about your music. Interaction is always fun!\nBack in the van for a short drive home. Only about 45 minutes. Thank you P Town.",

      "This one stood out. Cafe Indie—honestly, one of the coolest venues we’ve played. Tucked away in Scunthorpe, which isn’t exactly known for its sparkle, but this place? A shining star.\n We pulled up to the venue mid-afternoon, greeted straight away by Tom, the owner. You could just tell—passionate, considerate, absolutely buzzing about the night ahead. He gave us the run of the place and made sure everything was spot-on. A rare kind of host.\n Soundcheck was smooth. The in-house rig did the job nicely, and the room just felt right. One of those spaces where you know, before a single note is played, it’s going to sound big when the crowd’s in. Tom even took the time to check in during the check—little things like that go a long way.\n Grabbed some fish and chips not far from the venue—better than expected, crispy batter and not too greasy. Might’ve even said “Scunny’s alright actually.”\n Back inside, we caught wind of some of the names who’ve played here before—The Hunna and The Lottery Winners, which definitely raised the bar for us. Always surreal to share a stage that's hosted bands like that.\n The room started to fill up nicely and the energy built quick. Had a fair bit of banter flying around about Scunthorpe bottling promotion again—classic football chat. Being Boston lads, we couldn’t resist winding up a few of the locals. All good natured, but one bloke reckoned he’d never forgive us if they blew it this time in the playoffs.\n Set was tight, and the crowd were spot on!\n Afterwards we had more football chat at the merch table. We had a good catch up with a long term friend of ours, Joe. A fan right from the start and a good friend. Amazing that the band created a friendship like that! He was wearing merch from a long time ago. Always super cool! Might have to make that happen.\n Tom saw us off at the end like a proper legend. We'd go back in a flash—Scunny, we owe you one.",

      content: "This one had a bit of a different feel from the off. Ryan couldn’t make the show—personal matter that needed his attention. He’s doing fine, but it meant we had to push on without him. Never ideal, but the show must go on.\n We were down in Hertford, supporting the Bluetones of all people, which gave the whole day that slightly surreal, slightly ‘how did we get here?’ energy. It was a proper warm one too—shades on, doors open, beer garden kind of afternoon.\n Hertford turned it on for us. We ended up playing to a packed room, at least 200 heads in the place and all of them properly dialed in. It had that magic mix of curiosity and support—people wanting to know what we’re about, and giving it their attention. Loads of pats on the back after the set, a few people saying they'd heard of us but hadn’t seen us live yet.\n One proper London geezer came over—full cockney mode—hit us with some rhyming slang we had to decode on the spot. No clue what half of it meant but the vibes were immaculate.\n We stayed to catch the Bluetones' set after ours, pint in hand, just taking it in. Ryan would've loved it. We'll be back with the full squad next time, but Hertford did us proud."
